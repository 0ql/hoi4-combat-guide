# hoi4-Combat-width-simulator

Important features of this simulator:
- Change the province types you're fighting in.
- Change the weights relating to from how many sides you're attacking.
- Instead of plotting  (combat width penalty) on the y-axis, 
- (used combat width)*(combat width penalty) is plotted on the y-axis.
- This gives a more realistic view of your actual combat power.
